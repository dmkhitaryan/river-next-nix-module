    longDescription = ''
      notion-river is a static tiling window manager for the River Wayland compositor. Inspired by Notionwm (previously Ion3).
      As a result, unlike other tiling window managers, notion-river uses persistent frames. User has to explicitly split/unsplit layout.
      Additionally supporting floating mode, has waybar integration, and more.
